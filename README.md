# Finances
[Home page](https://jonestimd.github.io/finances)

An application for tracking personal finances using a SQL database.

Requires [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/).


## Database Support

* [MySql](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
* [Derby](https://db.apache.org/derby/) (embedded mode)

When using `MySql` or `PostgreSQL`, the database runs as a separate application
and must be installed separately.

When using `Derby`, the database runs as part of the application
and does not require a separate installation.
